								<p class="paragraph3">Innovative Gloves was founded in 2001 by Mr Rajeev Sood. Having served the industry since 1986 and built numerous plants ground-up, Mr Sood decided it was time to design one of the best production facilities Thailand had seen. Bringing together the most advanced state-of-the-art technology, a professional team endowed with 17+ years of experience in dipping technology and latex, this dream did not take long to realise. Innovative Gloves was conceived on a land of 20 acres and commissioned in September of 2001. </p>
								<p class="paragraph3">Despite facing humble beginnings in a tough economic climate where big players were openly out to destroy competition, the IGCL team's dedication and perseverance to succeed has always pulled through making us the most renowned and prestigious quality manufacturer in Thailand today. </p>
									<br>
								<p class="paragraph3" style="font-size:12pt !important; text-align:center;"> <b>Not one container till date has been rejected by a buyer.</b></p>
 									<br>

								<p class="paragraph3">Today IGCL produces no less than 1 billion gloves annually and we are even considering further expansion. The basic infrastructures have already been (successfully) installed with boilers erected and further expansions to come once all the necessary training to cope with the growth is completed. IGCL does not believe in expanding productions without ensuring that the promised growth is equally distributed across all segments of the company starting with production, quality assurance, administration, and training. Regular emphasis on developing new products and bringing in new technologies has not only made IGCL a survivor in the industry, but also created a niche segment of buyers whose intentions are to bring and introduce something a little different to the market.</p>
 									<br>

								<p class="paragraph3">With the finest quality natural rubber latex coming out from the heart of Songkhla - i.e., the world's highest yielding area for natural rubber - and an outstanding professional team endowed with specialised glove knowledge, IGCL is certified under ISO 9001; 2000 as well as ISO 13845. With 510K approvals on all the gloves, we are TGA and CMDCAS compliant. Audited by US FDA inspectors in 2002, we are also certified for maintaining an excellent GMP system.</p>
								 									<br>

								<p class="paragraph3">With a strong commitment to producing high quality gloves in an environment that is equally regarded and cared for through sound CSR policies, IGCL has become one of the top exporters of Nitrile and Latex Examination Gloves, meeting and even surpassing all relevant standards worldwide.</p>

							<h3>Clean Technology</h3>
							   <img src="images/pic9.jpg" title="Innovative Gloves">
							   <h5>INNOVATIVE GLOVES WAS THE FIRST GLOVE PRODUCER IN THE SOUTH OF THAILAND TO BRING IN CLEAN COAL-BURNING TECHNOLOGY.</h5>
							   <p class="paragraph2">Needless to say we are also the first to have been awarded clearance from various authorities for using clean coal technology/heating systems. Since implementing this technology not only have we saved exponentially on heavy costs, but sulphur emissions - which are considerably higher when burning oil - have also drastically declined. IGCL now seeks to acquire ISO 14000 certification in the next upcoming audits.</p>
							   <p class="paragraph2">Waste water from IGCL is so clear that our ponds are now home to a plethora of (edible) fish, given as charity to nearby villages. GO GREEN has always, since day one, been top priority to Mr Sood. So much so that he had once insisted each and every worker in the factory plant a tree. Today these trees make the factory one of the most beautiful factories in the region. Innovative Gloves also now has a small orchard where one will find the finest mangoes, guavas, rambutans (the list could go on) ever tasted. Mr Sood believes that the Mother Earth we inherit should be taken care of and looked after the same way one looks after their own mother.</p>
