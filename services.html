<br> <br>Innovative nitrile gloves are dipped thin for dexterity and comfort and do not afford the high degree of chemical protection that is found in heavier weight gloves that are dipped specifically for chemical use. These gloves do afford a degree of chemical "splash" protection and the above recommendations are meant to be used only as a guide when selecting gloves for any chemical contact use.Fully Diamond-textured surface

<h2>Unbreakable Nitrile</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
<p class = "paragraph" style = "font-style: italic; color:red !important; font-weight:bold"> 
	These Black Nitrile Gloves are the most suitable gloves for Automechanics, Engine Repairs, Oil Changes, and also for Vehicle Maintenance (Painting, Detailing, etc.)
</p>
	<p class="pHeader">
Description And Use 
</p>
<p class="paragraph"> 
Nitrile gloves are made from a synthetic polymer that exhibits rubber-like characteristics when vulcanized. This polymer is made in the form of a latex or emulsion and can be processed in a similar way to natural rubber latex.
<br><br>
While latex gloves continue to dominate the disposable gloves market, increasing incidences of allergies from these gloves have given rise to a need for non-allergic variants, namely nitrile. A property of the latter that makes it unique and distinguishes it from latex is that other than its non-allergic properties, the nitrile polymer allows for additional properties such as resistance to puncture, anti-slip grip, and anti-static and anti-fatigue properties.
<br><br>
The other main difference between natural rubber and nitrile latex is that because natural rubber is a linear polymer it has to undergo a precuring process to enhance its strength before dipping. Nitrile polymers, on the other hand, are inherently cross-linked during manufacture so very little if any precuring is needed to enhance strength. No matter what the ultimate end use, nitrile polymers can be significantly tailored to achieve a variety of needs. When it comes to natural rubber one is essentially limited by nature's creation, with no room for change.
